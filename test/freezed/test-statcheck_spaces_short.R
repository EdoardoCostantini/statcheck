### Project:     statcheck traineeship
### Object:      Testing local statcheck reads what it should
### Description: This script tests whether the local version of statcheck DOES
###              read statistics reported in ways we DO want to read.
###              The unwanted results controlled: 1) Different comparison signs, 
###                                               2) Positive/Negative stats, 
###                                               3) Different caps
###              any other result of interest can easly be added with another test
### Requirements: (1) local statcheck function (the one you are working on);
### How to use:  - set path to local statcheck
###              - run the suite.R script which is contained in the same folder as this script
### Output: If the updated/local function works as expected reports: ok
###         if not, reports the number of things that are done wrong
